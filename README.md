# Health Services Data Management

PySpark functions for CMS and other health services-related data management. 
These functions are designed to work with the Ohio SuperComputer (OSC) CMS data.
These functions may need to be slightly modified in order to be used with CMS data housed elsewhere in case there are
small differences in column names.

- Functions with name add_x_info add more than 1 column on the dataframe.
- Functions with name add_x add 1 column with column name x.
